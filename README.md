## Squid Game

This entire repository is coded by AI. I wrote 0 lines of code.

Time: 1.5 hours.

Every week, [@kohrachel](https://github.com/kohrachel/) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

### About The Project

This is a "Squid Game" minigame!

- Red Light, Green Light: Try to reach the finish line, but freeze when the doll turns around!
- Five more games not implemented (Honeycomb, Tug of War, Marbles, Glass Bridge, and the final Squid Game)
