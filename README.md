## Squid Game

<pre align="center">
ðŸŒ€ Part of the Vibe Coding Series
A weekly challenge to build something weird using only AI in 1 hour.

### About The Project

This is a "Squid Game" minigame!

- Red Light, Green Light: Try to reach the finish line, but freeze when the doll turns around!
- Five more games (Honeycomb, Tug of War, Marbles, Glass Bridge, and the final Squid Game) -- not implemented, because ran out of time ðŸ«

## Reflection

TLDR: 

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47a19421-81b6-4599-a6de-173f9e99bc2c" />


I used Cursor with `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` and `claude-3.7-sonnet` (occasionally switching between them). 

Some lessons: 

- AI is not perfect: Most feature I requested resulted in constant tweaking + back-and-forths fixes

- AI can create bugs: As code got longer, I started seeing more bugs accumulate (or maybe because my prompting got lazy?).

- AI can create bloated code: When I don't intervene in how the AI codes (which is the rule of this challenge), I noticed many bloated code starting to pile up

- I overestimated my ability with AI: I initially thought I could implement all 6 games within the 2 hours, but I could only implement 1 in the end.

Still, it was an invaluable + fun learning experience!
