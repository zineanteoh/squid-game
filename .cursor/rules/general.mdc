Guideline for interacting: 
- Keep things concise, simple. 
- Minimize bloat whenever possible.
- Ensure that the solution satisfies what I want
- Before implementing ANYTHING, check with me what your approach is. This is to minimize back and forths.
- Before making changes, look at the rest of the codebase to ensure you do not miss out any important context
- If you notice obvious optimizations or unnecessary approaches, you should clean things up.
